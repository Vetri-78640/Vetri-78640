👋 Hi, I’m @Vetri-78640
👀 I’m interested in building innovative tech, automation, front-end design (especially React), photography, and AI/ML.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced React, DSA, Trees, and probability for AI/DS.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-world web apps (like real estate platforms), chatbot builders, or any project involving clean UI/UX, automation, or AI.
📫 How to reach me: Preferably through GitHub or your portfolio (you can link it if you have one) and also through my instagram @im.vetri.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I dislike long variable names and comments in code—I keep it clean and efficient like a minimalist coder should.
