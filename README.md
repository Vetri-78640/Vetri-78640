“I’m Vetri, a computer science and AI professional with a deep interest in creative fields like photography, videography, Motion Graphics. My research focus lies in computer networking and cybersecurity, and I have prior experience in UI/UX design. I’m also an audiophile with a passion for collecting high resolution, lossless audio — especially FLAC libraries — and I deeply appreciate the beauty of nature.

Helping others is a core part of who I am, and I’m known for my versatile communication skills — whether it’s through everyday conversation or more strategic, ‘spy-level’ interactions. Cooking, to me, is an art form I’ve grown to love. And one of the quotes I live by is: ’It’s not a random thing I capture — sometimes, it’s the moment that demands me to capture it.’”
