• 👋 Hi, I’m @Vetri-78640.
• 👀 I’m interested in building innovative tech, automation, front-end design (especially React), photography, and AI/ML.
• 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced React, DSA, Trees, and probability for AI/DS.
• 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-world web apps (like real estate platforms), chatbot builders, or any project involving clean UI/UX, automation, or AI.
• 📫 How to reach me: Preferably through GitHub or your portfolio (you can link it if you have one) and also through my instagram @im.vetri.
• 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
• ⚡ Fun fact: I dislike long variable names and comments in code—I keep it clean and efficient like a minimalist coder should.
